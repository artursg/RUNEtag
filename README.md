# RUNETag 

**RUNETag** is a fiducial marker system which heavily relies on the robust framework of cyclic codes to offer superior occlusion resilience, accurate detection and robustness against various types of noise.

Our tags are composed by a set of circular high-contrast features (dots) spatially arranged into concentric layers. The reciprocal dot positions between layers is studied to allow the identification and pose estimation of the marker even with severe occlusions. Additionally, the marker interior is left free for any additional user payload.

## Compiling/Installing


RUNETag uses the following third-party libraries:

- [OpenCV]( http://opencv.org )
- [WinNTL]( http://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/tour-win.html ) (Included in the bundle)
- [Boost]( http://www.boost.org ) (For RUNEtagdetect executable)
- [Qt toolkit]( http://www.qt.io ) (For RUNETagGenerator)

Additionally, to build the library you will need [CMake](www.cmake.org) version 2.8 or higher.

### UBUNTU 20.04 - build instructions
#### 1. Install dependencies
```
sudo apt install libopencv-dev libntl-dev libboost-all-dev qt5-default
```
#### 2. Ensure that you got the path to the opencv cmake instructions
You need to set the `OpenCV_DIR` variable in the CMakeLists.txt in both subdirectiories 
in order to be able to link opencv properly. I found it here:
```
SET(OpenCV_DIR /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/opencv4/)
```

#### 3. Build
First, build the generation by 
```
cd RUNETagGenerator 
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Then do the same procedure for RUNETag directory.

### Basic steps to get started with RUNETags

1. Run the CMake build system to configure your build environment
2. Compile the source code
3. Run the *codegen* executable. A file called *codes.txt* will be created in the current directory
4. Run RUNETagGenerator and open the file *codes.txt*. Tags can now be browsed and personalized
5. Once a tag is selected, save it to generate two files: ```<tagname>.pdf``` and ```<tagname>.txt```
6. Print ```<tagname>.pdf``` ensuring that no scaling occurs
7. Calibrate your camera and run RUNEtagdetect, using ```<tagname>.txt``` as model file and with the appropriate
   camera calibration parameters
